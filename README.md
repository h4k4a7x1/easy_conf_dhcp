this program is an easy configurator for the server isc-dhcp-server.
what it can do?
it can configure all the basic info of your dhcp and can enroute automacly all the host.

how it work?

(Only the first time you have to edit the file static.yaml and put in the enp0s3 the info of your net.
after that put how is called your net tarjet and edit the name enp0s3.)

you only have to run the program restar.sh after that only have to write python3 easy_conf_dhcp.py
now the program will ask you some info that need to configurate all.

hope you use and enjoy it :)
